-- 12. Rich Wizard, Poor Wizard *
-- Give Mr. Bodrog some data to play his favorite game Rich Wizard, Poor Wizard. 
-- The rules are simple: You compare the deposits of every wizard with the wizard 
-- after him. If a wizard is the last one in the database, simply ignore it. 
-- At the end you have to sum the difference between the deposits:
--
-- host_wizard	host_wizard_deposit	guest_wizard	guest_wizard_deposit	difference	   
-- Harry		10 000				Tom				12 000					-2000	   
-- Tom			12 000				…				…						…	 
--
-- At the end your query should return a single value: the SUM of all differences:
--
-- sum_difference	   
-- 44393.97
